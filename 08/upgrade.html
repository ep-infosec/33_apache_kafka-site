<h3><a id="migrationtool">Upgrading from 0.7</a></h3>
Since 0.8 is not backward compatible with 0.7.x, we provide a tool for migrating data in an 0.7 cluster to an 0.8 cluster. Details of the tool can be found <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Migrating+from+0.7+to+0.8">here</a>.
